Haven't seen hide nor hair of him
He breasted his cards
He can't see the forest for the trees
He couldn't hit the broad side of a barn
He doesn't know what time it is,
He gave a hundred and ten percent
He got plastered
He got the short end of the stick
He has egg on his face
He has a few loose screws
He has a way with words
He knows which side his bread is buttered on
He learned his lesson
He left no stone unturned
He let the cat out of the bag
He looks like death warmed up
He made a mad dash for it
He never met a doughnut he didn't like
He put one over on me
He single-handedly destroyed an empire
He speaks with a forked tongue
He spilled the beans
He was aladdin in an orchard dripping with diamonds!
He was just a port in the storm
He was talking into his hat lying
He was the life of the party
He went the whole nine / 9 yards
He went to the school of hard knocks (university of life)
He who can, does; he who cannot, teaches

He who laughs last, laughs best
He who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword,
He will give the devil his due

He is toast
He's all flibberty jibbets
He's all hat and no cattle (added by popular demand!)
He's always blowing his own horn
He's bitten off more than he can chew
He's built like a brick shit-house
He's changing his tune
He's chomping at the bit
He's dressed to the nines
He's feeling his oats
He's fishing for compliments
He's gone to ground
He's got more money than he knows what to do with
He's got a bug up his ass
He's got the skills to pay the bills,
He's gunning for a fight
He's hen pecked
He's milk toast
He's not playing with a full deck
He's not the sharpest knife in the cabinet
He's pulling your leg
He's pushing up daisies
He's really laying it on thick
He's really on the ball
He's scared of his own shadow
He's so matter-of-fact
He's so ugly, he'd have to sneak up on a glass of water to get a drink
He's thinking with the wrong head
He's waiting for his ship to come in
He's a bald-faced liar
He's a bubble shy of plumb
He's a corn-fed hick
He's a dark horse
He's a fall guy

He's an inch deep and a mile wide

I didn't come down the clyde in a banana boat (scottish, glasgow)
I didn't expect the spanish inquisition

Idle chit-chat
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
If god had meant for man to fly, he would've given us wings
If his word were a bridge - you'd be afraid to cross!
If I had my druthers
If I had a nickel for every time he _, I'd be a millionaire
If I were in his shoes
If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times

If you've seen one you've seen 'em all
If your foresight was as good as your hindsight, we would be better by a far sight
If a frog had wings, he wouldn't bump his ass hopping
If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?
If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance of the law is no excuse
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In bed with one's boots on
In cahoots with
In every life a little rain must fall
In fine fettle
In full cry
In harm's way
In my mind's eye
In one ear and out the other
In one fell swoop
In seventh heaven
In stitches
In two (2) shakes of a lamb's tail
In your dreams
In your face
In a new york minute
In a nutshell
In a pickle,
In a pig's eye
In a pinch
In a quandary
In a trice
In a wink
In an interesting condition
In for a fleecing
In for a penny, in for a pound
In for the long haul
In over your head
In the bag
In the black
In the box-seat
In the buff
In the cards
In the clear
In the dark
In the doghouse
In the doldrums
In the hot seat
In the joint,
In the limelight
In the money
In the nick of time
In the offing
In the pink
In the red
In the rough
In the tank
In the twinkling of an eye
Indian summer
Inexorably drawn
Influence peddling
Info dump
Innocent as the day he was born
Intents and purposes
Irons in the fire
Is it soup yet?
Is nothing sacred?
Is this a dagger which I see before me?
Is a pig pork?
Is the pope catholic?
Isn't all it's cracked up to be
It ain't rocket science
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It all boils down to this
It came like a bolt from the blue
It isn't all sweetness and light
It just goes to show
It never rains but it pours
It sounds like a thrashing machine
It stands to reason
It takes two fools to argue
It takes two to tango
It took my breath away
It was a dark and stormy night
It was a piece of cake
It was a white-knuckle ride
It was an ill-fated idea
It will be a cold day in hell
It will do
It won't fly
It is all grist to the mill
It is better to give than to receive
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It is a long road without a turn
It's all cut and dried
It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye
It's all greek to me
It's all in your head
It's all over but the crying
It's autumn in her mouth and all her tongue can do is rustle!
It's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick
It's cutting edge
It's darkest just before the dawn
It's got a great beat, but you can't dance to it
It's just one of those days, I guess
It's like my daddy used to say
It's neck and neck
It's never too late to learn
It's no use crying over spilled milk
It's not all it's cracked up to be
It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game
It's not written in stone
It's not a sprint, it's a marathon
It's not over till it's over
It's not the heat it's the humidity
It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog
It's nothing earth-shattering
It's only a matter of time
It's raining like a cow pissing on a flat rock
It's what's on the inside that counts
It's a dog-eat-dog world
It's a doozy
It's a freckle past a hair
It's a game of inches
It's a lemon
It's a long shot
It's a one-horse town
It's a wash
It's an ill wind that blows no good
It's in the bag
It's on the tip on my tongue
Its all topsy turvy
Its a dog's life
Its a sure thing

Name your poison
Name and shame
Nary a word was spoken
Nasty, brutish and short
Nature's first green is gold
Near and dear to my heart
Neat as a pin
Necessary evil
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needless to say
Needs must
Neither fish nor flesh, nor good red herring
Neither fish nor fowl
Neither here nor there
Neither a borrower not a lender be
Nerves of steel
Nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof
Nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs
Nervous as a whore in church
Never cast a clout till may be out
Never give a sucker an even break
Never hurts to try
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
Never say never
Never in a month of sundays
Never the twain shall meet
Never-never land
New kid on the block
New lease on life
Nice cage, no bird
Nice day for a picnic
Nice guys finish last
Nice work, if you can get it
Nine days' wonder
Nip it in the bud
Nip and tuck
Nitty-gritty,
No accounting for taste
No dice
No go
No guts, no glory
No holds barred
No if's, and's, or but's about it
No love lost
No man is an island,
No more cakes and ale?
No one here but us chickens!
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked,
No room to swing a cat
No sh#t, sherlock
No skin off my back
No skin off my nose
No stone unturned
No strings attached
No time like the present
No use crying over spilled milk
No way (or why) on god's green earth
No way, josé,
Nod off
None too pleased
None of your business
Noodle on
Nose in the air
Nose to the grindstone
Not all it's cracked up to be
Not enough room to swing a cat
Not just another pretty face
Not my cup of tea
Not playing with a full deck
Not rowing with both oars
Not worth a hill of beans
Not a spinning wheel in the kingdom and then you prick your finger!
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
Not for all the tea in china
Not for nothing, but
Not in my back yard
Not on your tintype
Not the brightest bulb (in the box / on the tree / in the chandelier),
Not the ghost of a chance
Not the sharpest knife in the cabinet
Nothing new under the sun
Nothing personal,
Nothing succeeds like success
Nothing up my sleeve
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing to fear but fear itself
Nothing to sneeze at
Nothing to write home about
Now this won't hurt a bit
Now is the winter of our discontent
Now or never
Now's as good a time as any
Now's your chance
Numb as a hake
Number one fan
Numerous to mention
Nutty as a fruitcake
O romeo, romeo! Wherefore art thou romeo?
O ye, of little faith
Object of desire
Odds bodkins
Off like a prom dress!
Off your rocker

Off the shelf
Off the top of my head
Off the wagon

They're jumping the broomstick
They're like two peas in a pod
Thick as pea soup
Thick as thieves
Thick as a brick
Thick as a ditch
Thick headed
Thick and thin
Thin as six o'clock
Things are not always as they seem
Things aren't what they used to be
Things that go bump in the night
Think like a man, act like a woman
Think outside of the box
Think outside the box
Thinking with the wrong head
Third time lucky
Third time's a charm
Third time's the charm
Third wheel
Thirty thousand (30,000) foot level
This could be the start of something big
This day and age
This hurts me worse than it does you
This point in time
This town's not big enough for the two of us
This is for the birds
Thorn in my side
Those who do not look back from where they come from, will not reach their destination
Thou shalt not kill
Though this be madness, yet there is method in it
Three sheets to the wind
Three strikes and you are out
Three strikes and you're out
Three-score years and ten
Threw it with a little something on it
Threw up my hands (in concession/in disgust)
Threw a curve ball
Through thick and thin
Through the grapevine
Throw (toss) me some scraps,
Throw (toss) me a bone,
Throw (toss) your hat in the ring
Throw cold water on
Throw down
Throw gas (gasoline) on the fire
Throw someone to the wolves
Throw your hat into the ring
Throw a fit
Throw a monkey wrench into the works
Throw in the towel
Throw the baby out with the bathwater
Throw the book at him
Throwing caution to the wind
Throwing out the baby with the bathwater
Thumb your nose at
Thumbs up
Ticked off
Tickle the ivories,
Tickled pink
Tie the knot
Tied up right now
Tied to her apron strings
Tiger by the tail
Tight as a drum
Tight as the bark on a tree
Tight wad
Tighten your belt
Tighter than a gnat's ass
Till the cows come home
Till the fat lady sings
Tilting at windmills
Timber!
Time after time
Time flies when you're having fun
Time heals all wounds
Time stands still
Time waits for no man
Time will tell
Time and again
Time and tide wait for no man
Time and time again
Time is money
Time is running out
Time is up
Time is of the essence
Time is of the essense
Time of your life
Time on your hands
Time out
Time to pay the piper
Time's up
Time-honored
Times, they are a changing
Timing is everything

To go the whole hog,
To harp on,
To have cold feet,
To have a field day,
To have a gammy leg,
To hedge one's bets,
To hell in a hand basket,
To knock (or beat) the tar out of
To know beans,
To lark about,
To lie down with lions
To live from hand to mouth
To play hookey
To run amok
To save one's bacon
To shoot the crow
To skin a cat
To take aback,
To talk gibberish
To tell you the truth
To toy with,
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive,
To wreak havock
To a t
To the best of my knowledge
To the bitter end
To the manner born,
To the nth degree,
To the victor go the spoils,
Today is the first day of the rest of your life,
Toe the line
Toe-curling
Tomorrow is another day
Tongue lashing
Tongue tied
Tongue in cheek
Tongue-in-cheek
Too hot to handle
Too many chefs spoil the broth (soup),
Too many chiefs and not enough indians,
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Too much information (tmi)
Too much sail for a small craft
Too much of a good thing,
Too rich for my blood
Toodle-oo
Took me to the cleaners
Took off like a bat out of hell
Took off like a shot
Toot his own horn

Truth is stranger than fiction
Try as I might
Try it for free!
Try your hand at something
Trying to put a square peg in a round hole
Tuckered out
Tugging at heartstrings
Tune out
Turn up trumps
Turn your smile/frown upside-down
Turn a blind eye
Turn on a dime
Turn over a new leaf
Turn the other cheek
Turn the tables
Twelve good men and true
Twice as nice
Twice as strong as an ox and half as smart
Twiddling your thumbs
Twist my arm
Twist of fate
Twists and turns
Two cents' worth
Two heads are better than one
Two left feet
Two ships passing in the night
Two sides of the same coin
Two wrongs don't make a right
Two of a kind
Two to tango
Two's company, three's a crowd
Two-faced
U is part of us
Ugly as sin
Ugly as a hat full of holes
Ugly as a mud fence
Unbeknownst to me/him
Under her thumb
Under my skin
Under my wing
Under a microscope
Under the gun
Under the knife
Under the same roof
Under the sauce
Under the table
Under the weather
Understated elegance
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
Unexpected twist
Unless you are the lead dog, the view never changes
Unlucky at cards, lucky in love
Until the cows come home
Up his sleeve
Up sh#t creek
Up a blind alley
Up a creek without a paddle
Up a gum tree
Up for grabs
Up in arms
Up the ante

Urban myth
Useless as tits on a boar hog
Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut
Variety is the spice of life
Very real concern
View with alarm
Wait and see
Wait for the ink to dry
Waiting for your ship to come in
Waiting for the dust to settle
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
Waiting in the wings
Waiting with baited breath
Wake up living
Wake up and smell the coffee
Wake the dead
Wake-up call
Wakeup call
Waking up on the wrong side of the bed
Waking up with the chickens
Walk softly and carry a big stick
Walk on the wild side
Walk the plank
Walking on air
Walking on eggshells
Walking on sunshine
Walled garden
Walls have ears
Walls start closing in
Want my place in the sun
Warts and all
Was my face red
Wash your hands of something
Wash your mouth out with soap
Washed up
Waste not, want not
Wasted
Watch your mouth
Watch your tongue
Watch and wait
Watched pot never boils
Watching the clock
Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink
Wave the white flag
Way to go, einstein!
Way to a man's heart is through his stomach
We are not amused
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers
We have seen better days
We know where you live
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
We'll jump that fence when we get to it
We're going to burn the midnight oil
We're gonna tie one on tonight
We're not in kansas anymore
We're really going to town
We're sitting ducks
We've hit paydirt
Wear many hats
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Wear the trousers
Wearing nothin' but his birthday suit
Wearing the big girlie blouse (australian)
Weasel words
Weather the storm
Web of intrigue
Week of sundays
Welcome to my world
Welcome to the club
Well, how do you like them apples?
Went belly up
Went storming off in a huff
Went through the roof
Went over like a lead balloon
Were you born in a barn?
Were you raised by wolves?
Wet behind the ears
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am
What am I, chopped liver?
What are you like?
What are you stewing about?
What are you? Chicken?
What comes around, goes around
What does that have to do with the price of tea in china?
What god has joined together, let no man put asunder
What goes around comes around
What goes up, must come down
What part of "No" don't you understand?
What rock did you crawl out from under?
What you see is what you get
What a blast!
What a bummer
What a duck!
What a piece of work is man
What a tangled web we weave
What a way to go
What in tarnation?
What on earth is wrong with me?
What the cat dragged in
What the dickens
What the heck/hell
What's cookin', good lookin'?
What's going down?
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
What's he been smoking?
What's not to like
What's not to like?
What's up doc?
What's up with that?
What's wrong with this picture?
What's a little __ among friends
What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other smells just as sweet
What's the skinny?
Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Whatever floats your boat
Whatever tickles your fancy
Whatever turns you on
Wheeler-dealer
When all is said and done
When hell freezes over
When it comes to the crunch
When it rains, it pours
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,
When pigs fly
When push comes to shove
When rubber meets the road
When you lie with dogs, you catch fleas
When you start picking out people you start leaving people out
When in doubt, punt
When in rome, do as romans do
When the cat's away
When the cat's away, the mouse will play
When the chips are down
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the shit hits the fan
When the tide goes out the rocks begin to show
Where do you draw the line?
Where there is muck there's brass
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Where the rubber meets the road
Where's the beef?
Whet your appetite
Whew!
While away the hours
While you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
Whipping boy
Whistle down the wind
Whistle for it
Whistle in the dark
White as a sheet
White bread
White elephant
White knuckle ride
Who could forget
Who died and left you in charge?
Who died and made him king (god)?
Who has everything
Who pissed in your cheerios?
Who's the man?
Whoever dies with the most toys wins
Whole ball of wax
Whole hog
Whole nine yards
Whole other story
Whole shootin' match
Whoop it up
Whoops-a-daisy
Why buy the cow when the milk is free?
Why close the barn door after the horse is gone?
Why do today what you can put off 'til tomorrow?
Why don't we all chip in?
Why on god's green earth?

Wipe the slate clean
Wisdom of the ages
Wish you were here
Wish on a star
Wishy washy
Witch hunt
With bated breath
With one hand tied behind my back
With tongue firmly planted in cheek
With a grain of salt
Without benefit of clergy
Wnning is everything
Woe is me
Wolf at the door
Women and children first!
Wool gathering
Word for word
Words fail
Work like a dog
Work your fingers to the bone
Work into a lather
Work the crowd
Work the room
Work to a deadline
Worker bee
Working my last good nerve
World weary
World of hurt
World of trouble
World on a string
Worry wart
Worst nightmare
Worth its salt
Worth its weight in gold
Worthless as tits on a boar
Wouldn't kick her (him) outta bed for eatin' crackers
Wouldn't touch with a barge-pole
Wound tighter than a spring
Wrong end of the stick
Wrong side of the bed
Wrong side of the tracks

You don't miss the water till the well runs dry
You drive me crazy
You drive me nuts
You drive me up the wall
